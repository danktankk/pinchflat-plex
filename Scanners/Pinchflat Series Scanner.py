"""
Pinchflat Series Scanner â€“ Recursively maps YouTube channel folders to Plex episodes.
- Each channel folder under the library root becomes a TV show.
- Supports videos inside subfolders (e.g. date-named or "Season XX" folders).
- Episode title derived from filename (with any leading date removed).
- All videos are initially assigned to Season 1 (agent will regroup by year later).
Compatible with Plex 1.41+ (Python 2.7).
